# serverside-MEAN

This is a simple file that introduces the server-side MEAN stack. It uses Mongoose to simply the interaction with Mongo-DB. 
All the REST API call routes implement for posts and comments. 

# What it doesn't have
It currently doesn't use Module exports to clean up the code. In addition, it currently doesn't filter the comments based on the post specified. This is purely just to show the usuage of the MEAN stack.
